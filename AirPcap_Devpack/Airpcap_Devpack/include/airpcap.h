	\mainpage AirPcap interface documentation
	
	\section Introduction

	This document describes the data structures and the functions exported by the CACE Technologies AirPcap library.
	The AirPcap library provides low-level access to the AirPcap devices including advanced capabilities such as channel setting,
	link type control and WEP configuration.<br>
	This manual includes the following sections:

	- \ref airpcapfuncs
	- \ref airpcapdefs
	- \ref radiotap

	\note Throughout this documentation, \e device refers to a physical AirPcap device, while \e adapter is an open API
	instance. Most of the AirPcap API operations are adapter-specific but some of them, like setting the channel, are
	per-device and will be reflected on all the open adapters. These functions will have "Device" in their name, e.g.
	AirpcapSetDeviceChannel().
